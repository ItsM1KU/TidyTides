## ABSTRACT
The game educates players about the severe impact of ocean pollution on marine life and ecosystems. By interacting with the problem directly, players become more aware of the issue and the importance of ocean conservation.
Tidy Tides aligns closely with sustainable development goals, which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources. The game highlights the importance of reducing marine pollution and protecting marine biodiversity. 
Gamifying the process of learning about marine pollution and its solutions makes the educational experience more engaging and memorable, particularly for younger audiences.
